# \Creating Mobile Apps using Ionic Framework and ABP Framework

## Introduction

In this article, we will create an example application which will use the [ABP Framework](https://www.abp.io) as backend for a mobile application which can run on an iOS or Andriod mobile device using [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com).

Source Code of the completed application is avalibale on Github.

## Requirements

If you haven't used ABP or Ionic Framework before you need to install and setup a few things. So lets get strated.

### Node.js

In forder to install and run both ABP and Ionic Framework you first need to install the Node environment. You can either [download and install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/) or if you are on Mac [use Homebrew to install it like described here ](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac).

To test your setup, you can run the following two commands on the your CL:

```bash
node -v

npm -v
```

Make sure you can open your command line and get a result for both of the commands. Your versions might be different at the time of installing it but that should be okif you are up to date!
